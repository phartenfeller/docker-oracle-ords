This docker container will run Oracle ORDS in standalone mode.

_The reason why this image is not posted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is due to Oracle requiring that you download and accept their terms and conditions for ORDS._


## Pre-Install


Download [ORDS](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/rest-data-services/downloads/index.html). I'll assume that this is stored in your `~/Downloads` directory. The downloaded file will look like `~/Downloads/ords.18.1.1.95.1251.zip`

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/martindsouza/docker-oracle-ords.git
cd docker-oracle-ords

# Copy the ords*.zip file to files/ folder
# Make sure only one ords file is in files directory
cp ~/Downloads/ords-*.zip files/

```

## Build ORDS Docker Image

Note: tagging with ORDS version number allows you to have multiple ORDS images for each ORDS release.

```bash
ORDS_VERSION=19.4.0
docker build \
  -t oracle-ords:$ORDS_VERSION \
  -t oracle-ords:latest \
  .
```

## Run Container

This image allows you to run the ORDS container to either generate the ORDS configuration or use an existing one. Full explanations of all the supported [parameters](#parameters) is below.

### Generate Configuration

Running the ORDS container this way will setup the ORDS configuration in the mapped volume drive (`/opt/ords`) and only needs to be run once. The following commands demonstrate how to do this. It also has an optional `--rm` parameter that will remove the container after first use. This is used since we can use a "simpler" `run` command once the ORDS configuration exists. It also prevents the `-e` variables which contain the passwords to be attached to a container. 

```bash
#Note: DB_PORT is NOT the port that you mapped to your Oracle DB Docker image. It's the port that the database natively has open.
# It's recommended to leave it as 1521
# Optional: If DB is in another Docker machine include: --network=<docker_network_name> \
# ~/docker/ords/ords-18.1.1/config is the directory where the ORDS configuration will be saved. If it doesn't exist Docker will create it.
# 
# ORACLE XE Changes:
#
# DB_HOSTNAME=oracle-xe \
# DB_SERVICENAME=xepdb1 \
#
ORDS_CONF_DIR=~/docker/ords/19.4.0
ORDS_APEX_IMG_DIR=~/docker/files/apex/19.2.0/images

docker run -it --rm \
  --network=oracle_network \
  -e TZ=America/Edmonton \
  -e DB_HOSTNAME=oracle-xe \
  -e DB_PORT=1521 \
  -e DB_SERVICENAME=XEPDB1 \
  -e APEX_PUBLIC_USER_PASS=oracle \
  -e APEX_LISTENER_PASS=oracle \
  -e APEX_REST_PASS=oracle \
  -e ORDS_PASS=oracle \
  -e SYS_PASS=Oracle18 \
  --volume $ORDS_CONF_DIR/config:/opt/ords \
  --volume $ORDS_APEX_IMG_DIR:/ords/apex-images \
  -p 32513:8080 \
  oracle-ords:latest
```

On your laptop go to [localhost:32513/ords](http://localhost:32513/ords). For SQL Developer Web go to: http://localhost:32513/ords/sql-developer

### Configuration Exists

In this case ORDS will assume that your configuration exists (found in the mapped `/opt/ords` folder). A few differences to note from previous `run` command:

- Includes a `name` attribute. This will allows to reference the container by name when using `docker start ords` and `docker stop ords`.
- Does not include all database login information (since exists in configuration file)
- Does not self-remove
- `-d` (detached mode - optional) is used so that it does not lock the current terminal screen

```bash
docker run -it -d \
  --name=ords \
  --network=oracle_network \
  -e TZ=America/Edmonton \
  --volume ~/docker/ords/19.4.0/config:/opt/ords \
  --volume ~/docker/files/apex/19.2.0/images:/ords/apex-images \
  -p 32513:8080 \
  oracle-ords:latest
```

### Health Check

This container includes a healthcheck to ensure that ORDS is working properly:

```bash
docker ps

# Should result in something like the following
# Note the (healthy) status
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE        COMMAND                 CREATED       STATUS                  PORTS                    NAMES
b7694a2d62ba  ords:18.1.1  "/ords/config-run-orâ€¦"  15 hours ago  Up 15 hours (healthy)   0.0.0.0:32513->8080/tcp  ords
```

### Logs

If you want to see the logs from ORDS that would normally output on the screen you can run:

```bash
docker logs ords
```

Where `ords` is the name of your container.

## Container Parameters
Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`--name` | Optional: Name to label container
`--network` | Optional: If your database is part of a Docker network, attach this container to same network.
`-e TZ` | Optional: Timezone for ORDS
`-e DB_HOSTNAME` | Hostname of Oracle DB
`-e DB_PORT` | TNS port to DB. Note: If on a Docker Network don't use the mapped port. Most likely this will always be `1521`
`-e DB_SERVICENAME` | DB servicename
`-e APEX_PUBLIC_USER_PASS` | `APEX_PUBLIC_USER` password (to be created)
`-e APEX_LISTENER_PASS` | `APEX_LISTENER` password (to be created)
`-e APEX_REST_PASS` | `APEX_REST` password (to be created)
`-e ORDS_PASS` | `ORDS_PUBLIC_USER` password (to be created)
`-e SYS_PASS` | `SYS` password
`-e REST_SQL` | REST enabled SQL. Default: `true`
`-e FEATURE_SDW` | SQL Developer Web. Default: `true`. *Note: `REST_SQL` must be `true` as well*
`--volume <local dir>:/ords/apex-images` | Directory that contains images for APEX
`--volume <local dir>:/opt/ords`  | Optional: Directory to/that contains ORDS config. If this is not provided, the configuration will be saved in the container and will **not** be available if the container is deleted. If `defaults.xml` is not found in the folder ORDS will try to install.
`-p 1234:8080`  |  Port mapping, `8080` is the port in the container and can not be modified.


## Development

Start interactive Container:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint ash oracle-ords:latest
```
